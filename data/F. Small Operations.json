    "description": "Given an integer x and an integer k . In one operation, you can perform one of two actions: choose an integer 1 ≤ a ≤ k and assign x = x ⋅ a ; choose an integer 1 ≤ a ≤ k and assign x = x a , where the value of x a must be an integer. Find the minimum number of operations required to make the number x equal to y , or determine that it is impossible.",
    "input": "Input The first line of the input contains one integer t ( 1 ≤ t ≤ 10 4 ) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains three integers x , y and k ( 1 ≤ x , y , k ≤ 10 6 ). It is guaranteed that the sum of x and the sum of y across all test cases does not exceed 10 8 .",
    "output": "Output For each test case, output − 1 if it is impossible to achieve x = y using the given operations, and the minimum number of required operations otherwise.",
