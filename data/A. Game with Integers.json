    "description": "Vanya and Vova are playing a game. Players are given an integer n n . On their turn, the player can add 1 1 to the current integer or subtract 1 1 . The players take turns; Vanya starts. If after Vanya's move the integer is divisible by 3 3 , then he wins. If 10 10 moves have passed and Vanya has not won, then Vova wins. Write a program that, based on the integer n n , determines who will win if both players play optimally.",
    "input": "Input The first line contains the integer t t ( 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 ) — the number of test cases. The single line of each test case contains the integer n n ( 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000 ).",
    "output": "Output For each test case, print \" First \" without quotes if Vanya wins, and \" Second \" without quotes if Vova wins.",
