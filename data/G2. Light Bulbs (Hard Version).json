    "description": "The easy and hard versions of this problem differ only in the constraints on n n . In the hard version, the sum of values of n n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10 5 2 ⋅ 10 5 . Furthermore, there are no additional constraints on the value of n n in a single test case . There are 2 n 2 n light bulbs arranged in a row. Each light bulb has a color from 1 1 to n n ( exactly two light bulbs for each color ). Initially, all light bulbs are turned off. You choose a set of light bulbs S S that you initially turn on. After that, you can perform the following operations in any order any number of times: choose two light bulbs i i and j j of the same color , exactly one of which is on, and turn on the second one; choose three light bulbs i , j , k i , j , k , such that both light bulbs i i and k k are on and have the same color , and the light bulb j j is between them ( i < j < k i < j < k ), and turn on the light bulb j j . You want to choose a set of light bulbs S S that you initially turn on in such a way that by performing the described operations, you can ensure that all light bulbs are turned on. Calculate two numbers: the minimum size of the set S S that you initially turn on; the number of sets S S of minimum size (taken modulo 998244353 998244353 ).",
    "input": "Input The first line of the input contains a single integer t t ( 1 ≤ t ≤ 10 4 1 ≤ t ≤ 10 4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n n ( 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10 5 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10 5 ) — the number of pairs of light bulbs. The second line of each test case contains 2 n 2 n integers c 1 , c 2 , … , c 2 n c 1 , c 2 , … , c 2 n ( 1 ≤ c i ≤ n 1 ≤ c i ≤ n ), where c i c i is the color of the i i -th light bulb. For each color from 1 1 to n n , exactly two light bulbs have this color. Additional constraint on the input: the sum of values of n n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10 5 2 ⋅ 10 5 .",
    "output": "Output For each test case, output two integers: the minimum size of the set S S that you initially turn on; the number of sets S S of minimum size (taken modulo 998244353 998244353 ).",
