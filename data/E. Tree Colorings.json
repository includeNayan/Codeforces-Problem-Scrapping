    "description": "Consider a rooted undirected tree. Each vertex can be colored blue, green, or yellow. A coloring is called beautiful if it meets these conditions: the root of the tree is green; if you consider all blue and green vertices, they are reachable from each other without passing through any yellow vertices; if you consider all yellow and green vertices, they are reachable from each other without passing through any blue vertices; You are given an integer m. Your task is to calculate the minimum number of vertices in a tree with exactly m beautiful colorings.",
    "input": "InputThe first line contains a single integer (1≤t≤105) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains a single integer m (1≤m≤5⋅105).",
    "output": "OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of vertices in a tree with exactly m beautiful colorings. If such a tree does not exist, print −1.",

    "note": "NoteIn the following notes, let g describe green color, b be blue, and y be yellow.In the first example, consider a simple tree with just 1 vertex. This tree has exactly 1 beautiful coloring: the root is green.In the second example, consider a simple tree with 2 vertices with a root at the 1-st vertex. There are exactly 3 beautiful colorings: [g,g], [g,b] and [g,y].In the third example, consider a bamboo tree with 3 vertices with a root at the 1-st vertex. There are exactly 5 beautiful colorings: [g,g,g], [g,g,b], [g,g,y], [g,b,b] and [g,y,y].In the fifth example, consider a tree with 3 vertices with a root at the 1-st vertex, and the other 2 vertices connected to it. There are exactly 9 beautiful colorings: [g,g,g], [g,g,b], [g,g,y], [g,b,g], [g,b,b], [g,b,y], [g,y,g], [g,y,b] and [g,y,y].",
