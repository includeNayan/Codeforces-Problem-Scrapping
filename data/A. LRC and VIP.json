    "description": "You have an array a a of size n n — a 1 , a 2 , … a n a 1 , a 2 , … a n . You need to divide the n n elements into 2 2 sequences B B and C C , satisfying the following conditions: Each element belongs to exactly one sequence. Both sequences B B and C C contain at least one element. gcd gcd ( B 1 , B 2 , … , B | B | ) ≠ gcd ( C 1 , C 2 , … , C | C | ) ( B 1 , B 2 , … , B | B | ) ≠ gcd ( C 1 , C 2 , … , C | C | ) ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ gcd ( x , y ) gcd ( x , y ) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers x x and y y .",
    "input": "Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t t ( 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 ). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer n n ( 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 ). The second line of each test case contains n n integers a 1 , a 2 , … , a n a 1 , a 2 , … , a n ( 1 ≤ a i ≤ 10 4 1 ≤ a i ≤ 10 4 ).",
    "output": "Output For each test case, first output Yes if a solution exists or No if no solution exists. You may print each character in either case, for example YES and yEs will also be accepted. Only when there is a solution, output n integers on the second line. The i -th number should be either 1 or 2 . 1 represents that the element belongs to sequence B and 2 represents that the element belongs to sequence C . You should guarantee that 1 and 2 both appear at least once.",

    "note": "Note In the first test case, B = [ 51 , 9 ] and C = [ 1 , 20 ] . You can verify gcd ( B 1 , B 2 ) = 3 ≠ 1 = gcd ( C 1 , C 2 ) . In the second test case, it is impossible to find a solution. For example, suppose you distributed the first 3 elements to array B and then the last element to array C . You have B = [ 5 , 5 , 5 ] and C = [ 5 ] , but gcd ( B 1 , B 2 , B 3 ) = 5 = gcd ( C 1 ) . Hence it is invalid.",
