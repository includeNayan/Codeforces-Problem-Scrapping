    "description": "You are given an array of integers a 1 , a 2 , … , a n a 1 , a 2 , … , a n . You need to make it non-decreasing with the minimum number of operations. In one operation, you do the following: Choose an index 1 ≤ i ≤ n 1 ≤ i ≤ n , Set a i = a i ⋅ 2 a i = a i ⋅ 2 . An array b 1 , b 2 , … , b n b 1 , b 2 , … , b n is non-decreasing if b i ≤ b i + 1 b i ≤ b i + 1 for all 1 ≤ i < n 1 ≤ i < n .",
    "input": "Input Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t t ( 1 ≤ t ≤ 10 4 1 ≤ t ≤ 10 4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by their description. The first line of each test case contains an integer n n ( 1 ≤ n ≤ 10 5 1 ≤ n ≤ 10 5 ) — the size of the array a a . The second line of each test case contains n n integers a 1 , a 2 , … , a n a 1 , a 2 , … , a n ( 1 ≤ a i ≤ 10 9 1 ≤ a i ≤ 10 9 ). It is guaranteed that the sum of n n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10 5 2 ⋅ 10 5 .",
    "output": "Output For each test case, output the minimum number of operations needed to make the array non-decreasing.",

    "note": "Note No operations are needed in the first test case. In the second test case, we need to choose i = 2 i = 2 , after which the array will be [ 2 , 2 ] [ 2 , 2 ] . In the third test case, we can apply the following operations: Choose i = 3 i = 3 , after which the array will be [ 3 , 2 , 2 ] [ 3 , 2 , 2 ] , Choose i = 3 i = 3 , after which the array will be [ 3 , 2 , 4 ] [ 3 , 2 , 4 ] , Choose i = 2 i = 2 , after which the array will be [ 3 , 4 , 4 ] [ 3 , 4 , 4 ] .",
