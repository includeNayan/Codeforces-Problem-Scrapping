    "description": "Rudolph invented the game of tic-tac-toe for three players. It has classic rules, except for the third player who plays with pluses. Rudolf has a 3 × 3 3 × 3 field  — the result of the completed game. Each field cell contains either a cross, or a nought, or a plus sign, or nothing. The game is won by the player who makes a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row of 3 3 's of their symbols. Rudolph wants to find the result of the game. Either exactly one of the three players won or it ended in a draw. It is guaranteed that multiple players cannot win at the same time.",
    "input": "Input The first line contains one integer t t ( 1 ≤ t ≤ 10 4 1 ≤ t ≤ 10 4 ) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines, each of which consists of three characters. The symbol can be one of four: \"X\" means a cross, \"O\" means a nought, \"+\" means a plus, \".\" means an empty cell.",
    "output": "Output For each test case, print the string \"X\" if the crosses won, \"O\" if the noughts won, \"+\" if the pluses won, \"DRAW\" if there was a draw.",
