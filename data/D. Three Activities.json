    "title": "D. Three Activities",
    "description": "Winter holidays are coming up. They are going to last for n days. During the holidays, Monocarp wants to try all of these activities exactly once with his friends: go skiing; watch a movie in a cinema; play board games. Monocarp knows that, on the i -th day, exactly a i friends will join him for skiing, b i friends will join him for a movie and c i friends will join him for board games. Monocarp also knows that he can't try more than one activity in a single day. Thus, he asks you to help him choose three distinct days x , y , z in such a way that the total number of friends to join him for the activities ( a x + b y + c z ) is maximized.",
    "input": "Input The first line contains a single integer t ( 1 ≤ t ≤ 10 4 ) — the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n ( 3 ≤ n ≤ 10 5 ) — the duration of the winter holidays in days. The second line contains n integers a 1 , a 2 , … , a n ( 1 ≤ a i ≤ 10 8 ) — the number of friends that will join Monocarp for skiing on the i -th day. The third line contains n integers b 1 , b 2 , … , b n ( 1 ≤ b i ≤ 10 8 ) — the number of friends that will join Monocarp for a movie on the i -th day. The fourth line contains n integers c 1 , c 2 , … , c n ( 1 ≤ c i ≤ 10 8 ) — the number of friends that will join Monocarp for board games on the i -th day. The sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 10 5 .",
    "output": "Output For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum total number of friends that can join Monocarp for the activities on three distinct days.",

    "note": "Note In the first testcase, Monocarp can choose day 2 for skiing, day 1 for a movie and day 3 for board games. This way, a 2 = 10 friends will join him for skiing, b 1 = 10 friends will join him for a movie and c 3 = 10 friends will join him for board games. The total number of friends is 30 . In the second testcase, Monocarp can choose day 1 for skiing, day 4 for a movie and day 2 for board games. 30 + 20 + 25 = 75 friends in total. Note that Monocarp can't choose day 1 for all activities, because he can't try more than one activity in a single day. In the third testcase, Monocarp can choose day 2 for skiing, day 3 for a movie and day 7 for board games. 19 + 19 + 17 = 55 friends in total. In the fourth testcase, Monocarp can choose day 1 for skiing, day 4 for a movie and day 9 for board games. 17 + 19 + 20 = 56 friends in total.",
