    "title": "E. Kirei Attacks the Estate",
    "description": "Once, Kirei stealthily infiltrated the trap-filled estate of the Ainzbern family but was discovered by Kiritugu's familiar. Assessing his strength, Kirei decided to retreat. The estate is represented as a tree with n vertices, with the root at vertex 1 . Each vertex of the tree has a number a i recorded, which represents the danger of vertex i . Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. For a successful retreat, Kirei must compute the threat value for each vertex. The threat of a vertex is equal to the maximum alternating sum along the vertical path starting from that vertex. The alternating sum along the vertical path starting from vertex i is defined as a i − a p i + a p p i − … , where p i is the parent of vertex i on the path to the root (to vertex 1 ). For example, in the tree below, vertex 4 has the following vertical paths: [ 4 ] with an alternating sum of a 4 = 6 ; [ 4 , 3 ] with an alternating sum of a 4 − a 3 = 6 − 2 = 4 ; [ 4 , 3 , 2 ] with an alternating sum of a 4 − a 3 + a 2 = 6 − 2 + 5 = 9 ; [ 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 ] with an alternating sum of a 4 − a 3 + a 2 − a 1 = 6 − 2 + 5 − 4 = 5 . The dangers of the vertices are indicated in red. Help Kirei compute the threat values for all vertices and escape the estate.",
    "input": "Input The first line contains an integer t ( 1 ≤ t ≤ 10 4 ) — the number of test cases. The following describes the test cases. The first line contains an integer n ( 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10 5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree. The second line contains n integers a 1 , a 2 , … , a n ( 1 ≤ a i ≤ 10 9 ) — the dangers of the vertices. The next n − 1 lines contain the numbers v , u ( 1 ≤ v , u ≤ n , v ≠ u ) — the description of the edges of the tree. It is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10 5 . It is also guaranteed that the given set of edges forms a tree.",
    "output": "Output For each test case, output n integers — the threat of each vertex.",
