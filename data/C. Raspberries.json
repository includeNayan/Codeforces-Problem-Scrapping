    "description": "You are given an array of integers a 1 , a 2 , … , a n and a number k ( 2 ≤ k ≤ 5 ). In one operation, you can do the following: Choose an index 1 ≤ i ≤ n , Set a i = a i + 1 . Find the minimum number of operations needed to make the product of all the numbers in the array a 1 ⋅ a 2 ⋅ … ⋅ a n divisible by k .",
    "input": "Input Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t ( 1 ≤ t ≤ 10 4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k ( 2 ≤ n ≤ 10 5 , 2 ≤ k ≤ 5 ) — the size of the array a and the number k . The second line of each test case contains n integers a 1 , a 2 , … , a n ( 1 ≤ a i ≤ 10 ). It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10 5 .",
    "output": "Output For each test case, output the minimum number of operations needed to make the product of all the numbers in the array divisible by k .",

    "note": "Note In the first test case, we need to choose the index i = 2 twice. After that, the array will be a = [ 7 , 5 ] . The product of all the numbers in the array is 35 . In the fourth test case, the product of the numbers in the array is 120 , which is already divisible by 5 , so no operations are needed. In the eighth test case, we can perform two operations by choosing i = 2 and i = 3 in any order. After that, the array will be a = [ 1 , 6 , 10 ] . The product of the numbers in the array is 60 .",
