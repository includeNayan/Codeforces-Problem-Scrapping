    "title": "E. Boxes and Balls",
    "description": "There are n n boxes placed in a line. The boxes are numbered from 1 1 to n n . Some boxes contain one ball inside of them, the rest are empty. At least one box contains a ball and at least one box is empty. In one move, you have to choose a box with a ball inside and an adjacent empty box and move the ball from one box into another. Boxes i i and i + 1 i + 1 for all i i from 1 1 to n − 1 n − 1 are considered adjacent to each other. Boxes 1 1 and n n are not adjacent . How many different arrangements of balls exist after exactly k k moves are performed? Two arrangements are considered different if there is at least one such box that it contains a ball in one of them and doesn't contain a ball in the other one. Since the answer might be pretty large, print its remainder modulo 10 9 + 7 10 9 + 7 .",
    "input": "Input The first line contains two integers n n and k k ( 2 ≤ n ≤ 1500 2 ≤ n ≤ 1500 ; 1 ≤ k ≤ 1500 1 ≤ k ≤ 1500 ) — the number of boxes and the number of moves. The second line contains n n integers a 1 , a 2 , … , a n a 1 , a 2 , … , a n ( a i ∈ { 0 , 1 } a i ∈ { 0 , 1 } ) — 0 0 denotes an empty box and 1 1 denotes a box with a ball inside. There is at least one 0 0 and at least one 1 1 .",
    "output": "Output Print a single integer — the number of different arrangements of balls that can exist after exactly k k moves are performed, modulo 10 9 + 7 10 9 + 7 .",

    "note": "Note In the first example, there are the following possible arrangements: 0 1 1 0 — obtained after moving the ball from box 1 1 to box 2 2 ; 1 0 0 1 — obtained after moving the ball from box 3 3 to box 4 4 ; 1 1 0 0 — obtained after moving the ball from box 3 3 to box 2 2 . In the second example, there are the following possible arrangements: 1 0 1 0 — three ways to obtain that: just reverse the operation performed during the first move; 0 1 0 1 — obtained from either of the first two arrangements after the first move.",
